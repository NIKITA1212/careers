# Senior Infra Engineer

## Who we are

Smyte helps online apps stop spam, fraud, and compromised accounts. We were founded in late 2014 and are currently 12 people (most of whom are engineers). We work out of a book publisher’s office next to AT&T Park in San Francisco. We work with some of the largest online apps including Meetup, Musical.ly, Quora and GoFundMe, and we’ve never had a customer churn.

The core of what we do is “count things”. Some of these require new algorithms and databases that we’ve built in-house, others we find off-the-shelf solutions for and manage them in our production environment. We’ve got a ton of interesting problems, and at the moment we’re tackling them with a team of four experienced engineers (previously from Facebook, Google, etc.)

We’ve built a best-in-class social network spam and marketplace fraud tool, and our platform design means new verticals are just a matter of setting up new rules and machine learning models.

We’re looking for some more help. We’re set on finding another infrastructure engineer to help build out new features while retaining reliability.


## The ideal candidate would: 

* Be able to work onsite at our San Francisco, CA office.
* Have several years of experience developing and/or maintaining large-scale backend systems.
* Have DevOps, C++, Go, or stream processing experience (not required, but nice to have).


## Example projects

* Build a service in C++ and RocksDB that can find quantiles in an infinite stream of integers with changing distribution.
* Write a more efficient version of our domain-specific rule language that can run on-premise for some of our customers.
* Upgrade our Tensorflow-based machine learning pipeline to leverage GPUs.

## Why Smyte?

* We stop the victimization of innocent people online.
* We are the highest-quality product in this space.
* We have a seemingly endless supply of interesting technical problems.
* We have the strongest team tackling this problem.
* We just raised a series A and our growth is out of control.
* We offer competitive salary, benefits, and equity.
