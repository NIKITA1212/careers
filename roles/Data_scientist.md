# Smyte: data scientist

Smyte analyzes hundreds of millions of users and tens of thousands of events per second to stop spam, scams, credit card fraud, and online harassment on peer-to-peer marketplaces and social networks.

* Grow a brand new data science team.

## Why Smyte?
* We stop the victimization of innocent people online.
* We are the highest-quality product in this space.
* We have a seemingly endless supply of interesting technical problems and not enough people to work on them all.
* We have the strongest team tackling this problem.
* We just raised a series A and our growth is out of control.  
* We offer competitive salary, benefits, and equity.
