# Smyte: infrastructure engineer

Smyte analyzes hundreds of millions of users and tens of thousands of events per second to stop spam, scams, credit card fraud, and online harassment on peer-to-peer marketplaces and social networks.

Our whole company is just seven people, and scaling this infrastructure is a challenge. We are looking for an infrastructure engineer to help us out with the development and operations of our backend services.

## The ideal candidate would:
* Be able to work onsite at our San Francisco, CA office.
* Have several years of experience developing and/or maintaining large-scale backend systems.
* Have DevOps, C++, or stream processing experience (not required, but nice to have).

## Example projects
* Build a service in C++ and RocksDB that can find quantiles in an infinite stream of integers with changing distribution.
* Build a compiler for our domain-specific rule language that targets an individual machine (x86 machine code) and our data warehouse (SQL).
* Upgrade our Tensorflow-based machine learning pipeline to leverage GPUs.

## Why Smyte?
* We stop the victimization of innocent people online.
* We are the highest-quality product in this space.
* We have a seemingly endless supply of interesting technical problems and not enough people to work on them all.
* We have the strongest team tackling this problem.
* We just raised a series A and our growth is out of control.
* We offer competitive salary, benefits, and equity.
