# Smyte: office manager

Smyte analyzes hundreds of millions of users and tens of thousands of events per second to stop spam, scams, credit card fraud, and online harassment on peer-to-peer marketplaces and social networks.

Weâ€™re looking for someone to help us run our office.

## The ideal candidate would:
* Be able to work onsite at our San Francisco, CA office
* Be a generalist: we have a lot of varied work we need to get done and sometimes we don't know how to do it.

## Example projects
* Figure out how to scale our team lunches
* Schedule meetings for the team
* Manage several marketing projects
* Participate in the recruiting process

## Why Smyte?
* We stop the victimization of innocent people online.
* We are the highest-quality product in this space.
* We are small startup, so this isn't your average office manager job.
* We have the strongest team tackling this problem.
* We just raised a series A and our growth is out of control.  
* We offer competitive salary, benefits, and equity.
